> Finally, I hope this is the last "OpenGL" directory I have to create in my coding repository since I have been leaving this fantastic tutorial always at the midpoint (about the point where we learn about IBOs). Not sure if that is the midpoint or not. 

# Resource(s) used
- The most amazing resource ever -> https://learnopengl.com
- I have never came across a better wiki about a topic than this
- Do note that Arch Wiki comes very closer to this.

> This might be the first time I am using the SF Mono font in the regular weight and this akshually looks really cool

- 2025-02-05 23:09 > Making this as a separate repository so that I am actually reminded that I should complete this tutorial since I want my GitHub data chart to go up of course

> Motivation for me -> Remember when you went through like 50% of the FreeCodeCamp tutorial of OpenGL on your way back from Sikkim in Papa's RA when everyone else was taking rest and I was sitting in the Dining / Living Room part of the RA (Salon)
